# Daily Programming Challenges

First set of challenges will be from [The Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

12/28/2015 - Finished day 1 of Advent of code. Note: Be wary of using for in loops on anything other than an object. That method is meant to specifically iterate through object attributes in no particular order, which can cause errors when looping through arrays or strings.

12/29/2015 - Finished day 2 of AOC. Note: Javascript only accepts newlines using '/n', so you have to do some creative formatting when you try to use multi-line text from the internet. Javascript's sort method uses strings by default, use a [compare function](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp) to sort numbers.
